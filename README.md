QReceipts renders paper receipts irrelevant by providing invoices directly to your phone for easy access while managing your budget. Using QReceipts, when you buy items retailers, you can simply scan a QR code which will automatically send you a receipt created by our own POS system. No need to give your information to greedy newletters for your eReceipts. We acts as a middleware between retailers and consumers and provide both with a secure, anonymous connection.

## Why QReceipt?

### No more paper receipts
Let's face it, getting paper receipts from every transaction and keeping them overflowing in our wallet or around the house isn't optimal. Even more so when the invoice for the item you didn't think you'd refund suddenly disappears when you need it. 
### Anonymous shopping
E-receipts aren't new, but many companies that implement them will ask for user details (such as an email address) in order to send an invoice. They will then use that to gather more information and send newsletters and ads to their consumers. Instead of this, QReceipt will automatically send and store receipts for you, with no information given to the retailer.

### Easy storage
Never lose your receipts again, with offline and online storage.

### Faster for Retailers and Shoppers
QReceipt is easy to set up in stores, and faster to send receipts than printing one. For shoppers, you simply need to scan the QR Code shown after your purchase and it will be added to your storage. That's it!
