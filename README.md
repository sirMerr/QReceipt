QReceipts renders paper receipts irrelevant by providing invoices and a POS system. Using our system, when you buy items at specific retailers, you can simply scan a QR code which will automatically send you a receipt created by our own POS system. No need to give your information to greedy newletters for your eReceipts. We acts as a middleware between retailers and consumers and provide both with a secure, anonymous connection.
